Hi! My name is Ben, and this is my personal website. It's a place for both peers and prospective employers to get to know me, as well as a place to share my thoughts on software engineering, public speaking, research, and healthcare.

While I won't claim to be an expert on any of these things, I do have some valuable experiences that I love to share. I'm a national award winning speaker, mostly in collegiate speech and debate tournaments where my specialty is poetry interpretation. I spent the better part of a year interning with a missile research firm and I've played a **ton** of Kerbal Space Program, so I'll let you decide which of those experiences qualifies me to comment on aerospace topics. I worked for 6 years in pharmacy as a lead technician, so while I don't claim to be an expert in healthcare, I certainly have thoughts on our healthcare system which do come from an insider's perspective. 

Finally, I'm also a student in my last year of undergrad at Shepherd University studying Computer and Information Sciences. After finishing my undergrad, I'd like to obtain a PhD. Like most folks, I don't have everything figured out, but I do know I want to do research, and I believe my unique experience in public speaking and debate could allow me to lend a new perspective to fields like natural language processing and computational argumentation, as well as educating the future experts in these fields.

My ultimate goal for this site is that it'll be a less formal way of sharing my life experience and hopefully a way to find collaborators, employers, or even just people who are interested in the same things as I am.
